      Understanding exploitation in global supply chains and what can be done to protect vulnerable workers and children.

<!-- ================= WHAT IS FORCED LABOUR ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>What Is Forced Labour?</h2>
  <p>
    Forced labour occurs when people are made to work against their will under threat of punishment. This punishment does not always involve physical violence, it can also include withheld wages, debt bondage, threats to family members, confiscation of identity documents, or restrictions on movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forced labour exists in many industries worldwide, including agriculture, manufacturing, mining, construction, domestic work, and fishing. Because global supply chains are complex and often cross multiple countries, forced labour can remain hidden from both governments and consumers.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= WHAT IS CHILD LABOUR ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>What Is Child Labour?</h2>
  <p>
    Child labour refers to work that deprives children of their childhood, education, health, or dignity. Not all work done by children is considered harmful, but child labour becomes a serious issue when it interferes with schooling or exposes children to dangerous or exploitative conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation due to poverty, lack of access to education, displacement, and weak legal protections in some regions.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= WHAT IS CHILD SLAVERY ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>What Is Child Slavery?</h2>
  <p>
    Child slavery is an extreme form of child exploitation. It occurs when children are forced to work under conditions they cannot escape, often through coercion, threats, or control by others. Children in slavery may be denied freedom, education, and basic rights, and are unable to leave their situation safely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Child slavery is commonly linked to forced labour but can also involve other forms of exploitation, including trafficking.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= WHY PERSIST ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Why Forced Labour and Child Slavery Persist</h2>
  <p>
    Several factors contribute to the continued existence of forced labour and child slavery:
  </p>

  <div class="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Poverty and Economic Inequality</h3>
      <p>Lack of economic opportunities makes people vulnerable to exploitation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Limited Access to Education</h3>
      <p>Without education, children have fewer opportunities and protections.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Weak Labour Law Enforcement</h3>
      <p>Insufficient oversight allows unethical practices to continue.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Conflict and Displacement</h3>
      <p>Vulnerable populations in crisis situations face higher exploitation risks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Hidden Supply Chains</h3>
      <p>Complex supplier networks make it difficult to track where products are made.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Insufficient Oversight</h3>
      <p>Unethical practices remain hidden due to lack of transparency and monitoring.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ================= GLOBAL IMPACT ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Global Impact</h2>
  <p>
    Millions of people worldwide are affected by forced labour and child exploitation. These practices generate significant illegal profits while denying workers and children their basic rights and opportunities. The impact extends beyond individuals, reinforcing cycles of poverty and inequality within communities.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= CONSUMER AWARENESS ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Why Consumer Awareness Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Many consumers are unaware that everyday products can be linked to forced labour or child exploitation. Increasing awareness helps create demand for transparency and ethical sourcing. When consumers ask questions and support responsible companies, businesses face greater pressure to improve labour practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Awareness is a critical step toward accountability and change.</strong>
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= HOW FORCED LABOUR SHOWS UP ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>How Forced Labour Shows Up in Everyday Products</h2>
  <p>Here are common product categories where forced labour or child labour risks are known to appear.</p>

  <div class="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <img src="undershirt.png" alt="Undershirt icon" class="card-icon">
      <h3>Clothing &amp; Textiles</h3>
      <p>Raw cotton and denim production often involves seasonal work and subcontracted farms where oversight is limited.</p>
      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Garment value chains are long and opaque, hiding labour risk upstream.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="circuit.png" alt="Circuit icon" class="card-icon">
      <h3>Electronics</h3>
      <p>Mining for minerals and battery production can involve hazardous conditions and informal labour arrangements.</p>
      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Small parts and components come from many suppliers, increasing risk.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="shrimp.png" alt="Shrimp icon" class="card-icon">
      <h3>Seafood</h3>
      <p>Fishing fleets and processing plants sometimes rely on coerced or debt-bonded workers at sea.</p>
      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Offshore work is hard to monitor and workers can be isolated.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="chocolate.png" alt="Chocolate icon" class="card-icon">
      <h3>Chocolate &amp; Coffee</h3>
      <p>Agricultural harvesting and smallholder farms are high-risk settings for child labour and exploitation.</p>
      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Seasonal harvests and informal labour make protections inconsistent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="pickaxe.png" alt="Pickaxe icon" class="card-icon">
      <h3>Mining &amp; Raw Materials</h3>
      <p>Artisanal mining and subcontracted supply chains can involve children and forced labour for high-demand minerals.</p>
      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Minerals feed many industries, making the problem widespread.</p>

<!-- ================= A PRODUCT'S JOURNEY ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>A Product's Journey</h2>
  <p>Risks can enter products at multiple steps along the supply chain.</p>

  <div class="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Raw Materials</h3>
      <p>Forced labour is often hidden in agriculture and mining, far from consumer visibility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Manufacturing</h3>
      <p>Subcontracting and informal factories can create gaps in oversight and worker protections.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Assembly</h3>
      <p>Assembly plants may use temporary or agency labour with weak contracts and limited rights.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Shipping &amp; Retail</h3>
      <p>Long logistics chains and multiple intermediaries make tracing labour conditions difficult.</p>

<!-- ================= FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Is every product made with forced labour?</h3>
      <p>No. Risk varies by product, supplier and region. Our tool highlights where risks have been reported so you can investigate further.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Does "ethical" mean perfect?</h3>
      <p>Not necessarily. Ethical sourcing reduces risk but does not guarantee perfection. Transparency and continuous improvement matter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Why don't companies disclose this information?</h3>
      <p>Disclosure can be costly and complex. Many companies lack oversight of deeper supplier tiers or fear reputational risk.</p>
