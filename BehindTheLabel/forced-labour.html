    <p>
      Understanding exploitation in global supply chains and what can be done to protect vulnerable workers and children.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ================= WHAT IS FORCED LABOUR ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>What Is Forced Labour?</h2>
  <p>
    Forced labour occurs when people are made to work against their will under threat of punishment. This punishment does not always involve physical violence — it can also include withheld wages, debt bondage, threats to family members, confiscation of identity documents, or restrictions on movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forced labour exists in many industries worldwide, including agriculture, manufacturing, mining, construction, domestic work, and fishing. Because global supply chains are complex and often cross multiple countries, forced labour can remain hidden from both governments and consumers.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= WHAT IS CHILD LABOUR ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>What Is Child Labour?</h2>
  <p>
    Child labour refers to work that deprives children of their childhood, education, health, or dignity. Not all work done by children is considered harmful, but child labour becomes a serious issue when it interferes with schooling or exposes children to dangerous or exploitative conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation due to poverty, lack of access to education, displacement, and weak legal protections in some regions.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= WHAT IS CHILD SLAVERY ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>What Is Child Slavery?</h2>
  <p>
    Child slavery is an extreme form of child exploitation. It occurs when children are forced to work under conditions they cannot escape, often through coercion, threats, or control by others. Children in slavery may be denied freedom, education, and basic rights, and are unable to leave their situation safely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Child slavery is commonly linked to forced labour but can also involve other forms of exploitation, including trafficking.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= WHY PERSIST ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Why Forced Labour and Child Slavery Persist</h2>
  <p>
    Several factors contribute to the continued existence of forced labour and child slavery:
  </p>

  <div class="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Poverty and Economic Inequality</h3>
      <p>Lack of economic opportunities makes people vulnerable to exploitation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Limited Access to Education</h3>
      <p>Without education, children have fewer opportunities and protections.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Weak Labour Law Enforcement</h3>
      <p>Insufficient oversight allows unethical practices to continue.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Conflict and Displacement</h3>
      <p>Vulnerable populations in crisis situations face higher exploitation risks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Hidden Supply Chains</h3>
      <p>Complex supplier networks make it difficult to track where products are made.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Insufficient Oversight</h3>
      <p>Unethical practices remain hidden due to lack of transparency and monitoring.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ================= GLOBAL IMPACT ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Global Impact</h2>
  <p>
    Millions of people worldwide are affected by forced labour and child exploitation. These practices generate significant illegal profits while denying workers and children their basic rights and opportunities. The impact extends beyond individuals, reinforcing cycles of poverty and inequality within communities.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= CONSUMER AWARENESS ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Why Consumer Awareness Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Many consumers are unaware that everyday products can be linked to forced labour or child exploitation. Increasing awareness helps create demand for transparency and ethical sourcing. When consumers ask questions and support responsible companies, businesses face greater pressure to improve labour practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Awareness is a critical step toward accountability and change.</strong>
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= WHAT CAN BE DONE ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>What Can Be Done</h2>
  <p>
    Addressing forced labour and child slavery requires cooperation between governments, businesses, and consumers. Key actions include:
  </p>

  <ul class="feature-list">
    <li>✔ Stronger labour laws and enforcement</li>
    <li>✔ Greater supply chain transparency</li>
    <li>✔ Independent monitoring and reporting</li>
    <li>✔ Corporate accountability</li>
    <li>✔ Informed consumer choices</li>
  </ul>
